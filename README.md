This is an unofficial iOS client for browsing [StartupJobs](https://www.startupjobs.cz/) listings. I wanted to be able to browse jobs while on the go and didn't like the mobile web experience. 

This is a personal practice project, I'm not affiliated with StartupJobs.

Technologies used:
- [Tuist](https://tuist.dev/) for project setup
- MVVM-C: UIKit navigation with SwiftUI views
- [Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick) for testing
- [Mocker](https://github.com/WeTransfer/Mocker) for request mocking
